               traffic accidents, fatalities and injuries in three
               Municipalities of Dar es Salaam Region, Tanzania between
               2014-2018",
  author    = "Walugembe, Francis and Levira, Francis and Ganesh,

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Over 90\% of injuries and deaths still occur in
               low and middle-income countries like Tanzania due to Road
               traffic accidents. Available literature indicates that Tanzania
               suffers massive human and economic losses every year from RTAs
               despite several interventions that have been made to curb this
               scourge. To gain an insight into the current state of RTAs we
               examined the pre- historical case fatality rates from RTAs in
               Ilala and two other municipalities (Kinondoni and Temeke) in Dar
               es Salaam Region, Tanzania. METHODS: We conducted a
               retrospective study using the secondary data on road accidents
               from Road Accident Information System (RAIS) for the period 2014
               to 2018. RESULTS: A total of 6,772 road traffic injuries were
               reported between 2014 and 2018 and the study recorded the
               highest RTAs in the year 2014 as compared to the other years
               within the study period. The death rate from RTAs in Ilala
               Municipality alone was 36.4 per 100,000 population. About 28\%
               of the total fatalities were recorded among the pedestrians, and
               there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the RTAs among
               the other road users. CONCLUSION: The study recommends the
               improvement of road transport infrastructure to ensure safety
               for all the road users by implementing the existing policies,
               strengthening the enforcement of existing legislation and
               introducing express penalties on a real-time basis. We encourage
               the use of this data to develop strategies in Tanzania that
               protect pedestrians and other vulnerable road users from RTAs.",

abstract="The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method is one of the data mining techniques considered to be among the top 10 techniques for data mining [237]. The k-NN method uses the well-known principle of Cicero pares cum paribus facillime congregantur (birds of a feather flock together or literally equals with equals easily associate). It tries to classify an unknown sample based on the known classification of its neighbors. Let us suppose that a set of samples with known classification is available, the so-called training set. Intuitively, each sample should be classified similarly to its surrounding samples. Therefore, if the classification of a sample is unknown, then it could be predicted by considering the classification of its nearest neighbor samples. Given an unknown sample and a training set, all the distances between the unknown sample and all the samples in the training set can be computed. The distance with the smallest value corresponds to the sample in the training set closest to the unknown sample. Therefore, the unknown sample may be classified based on the classification of this nearest neighbor.",

    ABSTRACT = {Driver distraction is considered a main cause of road accidents, every year, thousands of people obtain serious injuries, and most of them lose their lives. In addition, a continuous increase can be found in road accidents due to driver’s distractions, such as talking, drinking, and using electronic devices, among others. Similarly, several researchers have developed different traditional deep learning techniques for the efficient detection of driver activity. However, the current studies need further improvement due to the higher number of false predictions in real time. To cope with these issues, it is significant to develop an effective technique which detects driver’s behavior in real time to prevent human lives and their property from being damaged. In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based technique with the integration of a channel attention (CA) mechanism for efficient and effective detection of driver behavior. Moreover, we compared the proposed model with solo and integration flavors of various backbone models and CA such as VGG16, VGG16+CA, ResNet50, ResNet50+CA, Xception, Xception+CA, InceptionV3, InceptionV3+CA, and EfficientNetB0. Additionally, the proposed model obtained optimal performance in terms of evaluation metrics, for instance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using two well-known datasets such as AUC Distracted Driver (AUCD2) and State Farm Distracted Driver Detection (SFD3). The proposed model achieved 99.58% result in terms of accuracy using SFD3 while 98.97% accuracy on AUCD2 datasets.},

    abstract = {Recently, the number of road accidents has been increased worldwide due to the distraction of the drivers. This rapid road crush often leads to injuries, loss of properties, even deaths of the people. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and analyze the driver's behavior during the driving time to detect the distraction and mitigate the number of road accident. To detect various kinds of behavior like- using cell phone, talking to others, eating, sleeping or lack of concentration during driving; machine learning/deep learning can play significant role. However, this process may need high computational capacity to train the model by huge number of training dataset. In this paper, we made an effort to develop CNN based method to detect distracted driver and identify the cause of distractions like talking, sleeping or eating by means of face and hand localization. Four architectures namely CNN, VGG-16, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 have been adopted for transfer learning. To verify the effectiveness, the proposed model is trained with thousands of images from a publicly available dataset containing ten different postures or conditions of a distracted driver and analyzed the results using various performance metrics. The performance results showed that the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model has the best classification efficiency.}

    ABSTRACT = {Traditional methods for behavior detection of distracted drivers are not capable of capturing driver behavior features related to complex temporal features. With the goal to improve transportation safety and to reduce fatal accidents on roads, this research article presents a Hybrid Scheme for the Detection of Distracted Driving called HSDDD. This scheme is based on a strategy of aggregating handcrafted and deep CNN features. HSDDD is based on three-tiered architecture. The three tiers are named as Coordination tier, Concatenation tier and Classification tier. We first obtain HOG features by using handcrafted algorithms, and then at the coordination tier, we leverage four deep CNN models including AlexNet, Inception V3, Resnet50 and VGG-16 for extracting DCNN features. DCNN extracted features are fused with HOG extracted features at the Concatenation tier. Then PCA is used as a feature selection technique. PCA takes both the extracted features and removes the redundant and irrelevant information, and it improves the classification performance. After feature fusion and feature selection, the two classifiers, KNN and SVM, at the Classification tier take the selected features and classify the ten classes of distracted driving behaviors. We evaluate our proposed scheme and observe its performance by using the accuracy metrics.},

    abstract = {The accurate evaluation of crash causal factors can provide fundamental information for effective transportation policy, vehicle design, and driver education. Naturalistic driving (ND) data collected with multiple onboard video cameras and sensors provide a unique opportunity to evaluate risk factors during the seconds leading up to a crash. This paper uses a National Academy of Sciences-sponsored ND dataset comprising 905 injurious and property damage crash events, the magnitude of which allows the first direct analysis (to our knowledge) of causal factors using crashes only. The results show that crash causation has shifted dramatically in recent years, with driver-related factors (i.e., error, impairment, fatigue, and distraction) present in almost 90\% of crashes. The results also definitively show that distraction is detrimental to driver safety, with handheld electronic devices having high use rates and risk.}

abstract = {Rare objects are often of great interest and great value. Until recently, however, rarity has not received much attention in the context of data mining. Now, as increasingly complex real-world problems are addressed, rarity, and the related problem of imbalanced data, are taking center stage. This article discusses the role that rare classes and rare cases play in data mining. The problems that can result from these two forms of rarity are described in detail, as are methods for addressing these problems. These descriptions utilize examples from existing research. So that this article provides a good survey of the literature on rarity in data mining. This article also demonstrates that rare classes and rare cases are very similar phenomena---both forms of rarity are shown to cause similar problems during data mining and benefit from the same remediation methods.},
