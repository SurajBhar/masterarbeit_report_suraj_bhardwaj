# Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my Master's thesis: **"Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning"**. The thesis explores the application of self-supervised learning techniques to enhance driver distraction detection, leveraging novel model architectures and training methodologies.

The thesis document is organized into distinct chapters, each implemented as separate LaTeX files, which are compiled into the final PDF using a modified ICLR2024 LaTeX template.

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the full thesis document into a PDF, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (such as TeX Live or MikTeX), along with any necessary packages for bibliography and image handling.
Or You can use Overleaf to compile it.

## LaTeX Template
The LaTeX template used in this thesis is based on the ICLR2024 conference template. The structure has been modified to accommodate the writing of a thesis document while retaining the clean formatting and styles originally intended for conference papers. All modifications are done to extend the capabilities of the template, including chapter-based content division, a dedicated bibliography, and glossary support.

## Images and Figures
All images used in the thesis are stored in the **"Images_Thesis/"** folder. Ensure that the paths are correct in the LaTeX files for smooth compilation. The images are referenced throughout the chapters to support the analysis and results presented.

## Bibliography
The bibliography is managed using the BibTeX format. References are listed in the iclr2024_conference.bib file and follow the citation style defined in the iclr2024_conference.bst BibTeX style file.

## Contributions
This thesis work was carried out as part of my Master's research, with contributions from my advisors. For further inquiries or collaboration opportunities, please contact me via email.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the ICLR2024 conference for the template used in the creation of this document. The template has been adapted to fit the scope of a thesis while maintaining the integrity of its original design.
