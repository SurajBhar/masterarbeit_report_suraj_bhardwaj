# Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my Master's thesis: **"Improved Driver Distraction Detection Using Self-Supervised Learning"**. The thesis explores the application of self-supervised learning techniques to enhance driver distraction detection, leveraging novel model architectures and training methodologies.

The thesis document is organized into distinct chapters, each implemented as separate LaTeX files, which are compiled into the final PDF using a modified ICLR2024 LaTeX template.
